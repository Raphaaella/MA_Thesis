Some of these actors are probably more trusted by the general public than others. On the other hand, the channels that are used to communicate science are also not trusted equally.

	abstract = {Concerns about public misinformation in the United States—ranging from politics to science—are growing. Here, we provide an overview of how and why citizens become (and sometimes remain) misinformed about science. Our discussion focuses specifically on misinformation among individual citizens. However, it is impossible to understand individual information processing and acceptance without taking into account social networks, information ecologies, and other macro-level variables that provide important social context. Specifically, we show how being misinformed is a function of a person’s ability and motivation to spot falsehoods, but also of other group-level and societal factors that increase the chances of citizens to be exposed to correct(ive) information. We conclude by discussing a number of research areas—some of which echo themes of the 2017 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s
              Communicating Science Effectively
              report—that will be particularly important for our future understanding of misinformation, specifically a systems approach to the problem of misinformation, the need for more systematic analyses of science communication in new media environments, and a (re)focusing on traditionally underserved audiences.},

The reason is that one topic or event that consists of multiple tweets, has more features and characteristics than a single tweet. In this paper, we propose two variations of Heterogeneous Bass models (HBass), originally developed in the field of marketing science, namely Spatial-Temporal Heterogeneous Bass Model (ST-HBass) and Feature-Driven Heterogeneous Bass Model (FDHBass), to predict the popularity of a single tweet at the early stage and the stable stage. We further design an Interaction Enhancement to improve the performance, which considers the competition and cooperation from different tweets with the common topic. In addition, it is often difficult to depict popularity quantitatively. We design an experiment to get the weight of favorite, retweet and reply, and apply the linear regression to calculate the popularity. Furthermore, we design a clustering method to bound the popular threshold. Once the weight and popular threshold are determined, the status whether a tweet will be popular or not can be justified. Our model is validated by conducting experiments on real-world Twitter data, and the results show the efficiency and accuracy of our model, with less absolute percent error and the best Precision and F-score. In all, we introduce Bass model into social network single-tweet prediction to show it can achieve excellent performance.},

In this paper, we propose STH-Bass, a Spatial and Temporal Heterogeneous Bass model derived from economic ﬁeld, to predict the popularity of a single tweet. Leveraging only the ﬁrst day’s information after a tweet is posted, STH-Bass can not only predict the trend of a tweet with favorite count and retweet count, but also classify whether the tweet will be popular in the future. We perform extensive experiments to evaluate the eﬃciency and accuracy of STHBass based on real-world Twitter data. The evaluation results show that STH-Bass obtains much less APE than the baselines when predicting the trend of a single tweet, and an average of 24 \% higher precision when classifying the tweets popularity.},

We analyze the linguistic traces of those contrasting perspectives in Congressional speeches from 1879 to 2022. We find that evidence-based language has continued to decline since the mid-1970s, together with a decline in legislative productivity. The decline was accompanied by increasing partisan polarization in Congress and rising income inequality in society.

We also disentangle the ability to discern between true and false news (discrimination ability) from the response bias, that is, a tendency to label news as either true (true-news bias) or false (false-news bias). We find that older age, higher analytic thinking skills, and identifying as a Democrat are associated with higher discrimination ability. Older age and higher analytical thinking skills are also associated with a false-news bias (caution). In contrast, ideological congruency, motivated reflection, and familiarity are associated with a true-news bias (naïvety).

	abstract = {Link prediction attempts to predict whether an unseen edge exists based on only a portion of edges of a graph. A flurry of methods have been introduced in recent years that attempt to make use of graph neural networks (GNNs) for this task. Furthermore, new and diverse datasets have also been created to better evaluate the effectiveness of these new models. However, multiple pitfalls currently exist that hinder our ability to properly evaluate these new methods. These pitfalls mainly include: (1) Lower than actual performance on multiple baselines, (2) A lack of a unified data split and evaluation metric on some datasets, and (3) An unrealistic evaluation setting that uses easy negative samples. To overcome these challenges, we first conduct a fair comparison across prominent methods and datasets, utilizing the same dataset and hyperparameter search settings. We then create a more practical evaluation setting based on a Heuristic Related Sampling Technique (HeaRT), which samples hard negative samples via multiple heuristics. The new evaluation setting helps promote new challenges and opportunities in link prediction by aligning the evaluation with real-world situations. Our implementation and data are available at https://github.com/Juanhui28/HeaRT.},

This study elucidates the susceptibility of GNN to discrepancies arising from imbalanced node labels. Conventional solutions for imbalanced classification, such as resampling, falter in node classification task, primarily due to their negligence of graph structure. Worse still, they often exacerbate the model’s inclination towards overfitting or underfitting, especially in the absence of adequate priori knowledge. To circumvent these limitations, we introduce a novel Graph Neural Network framework with Curriculum Learning (GNN-CL). This framework integrates two pivotal components. Initially, leveraging the principles of smoothness and homophily, we endeavor to procure dependable interpolation nodes and edges via adaptive graph oversampling. For another, we combine the Graph Classification Loss with the Metric Learning Loss, thereby refining the spatial proximity of nodes linked to the minority class in the feature space. Drawing inspiration from curriculum learning, the parameters of these components are dynamically modulated during the training phase to accentuate generalization and discrimination capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on several widely used graph datasets affirm the superiority of our proposed model, which consistently outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {Although significant effort has been applied to fact-checking, the prevalence of fake news over social media, which has profound impact on justice, public trust and our society as a whole, remains a serious problem. In this work, we focus on propagation-based fake news detection, as recent studies have demonstrated that fake news and real news spread differently online. Specifically, considering the capability of graph neural networks (GNNs) in dealing with non-Euclidean data, we use GNNs to differentiate between the propagation patterns of fake and real news on social media. In particular, we concentrate on two questions: (1) Without relying on any text information, e.g., tweet content, replies and user descriptions, how accurately can GNNs identify fake news? Machine learning models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial attacks, and avoiding the dependence on text-based features can make the model less susceptible to the manipulation of advanced fake news fabricators. (2) How to deal with new, unseen data? In other words, how does a GNN trained on a given dataset perform on a new and potentially vastly different dataset? If it achieves unsatisfactory performance, how do we solve the problem without re-training the model on the entire data from scratch, which would become prohibitively expensive in practice as the data volumes grow? We study the above questions on two datasets with thousands of labelled news items, and our results show that: (1) GNNs can achieve comparable or superior performance without any text information to state-of-the-art methods. (2) GNNs trained on a given dataset may perform poorly on new, unseen data, and direct incremental training cannot solve the problem—this issue has not been addressed in the previous work that applies GNNs for fake news detection. In order to solve the problem, we propose a method that achieves balanced performance on both existing and new datasets, by using techniques from continual learning to train GNNs incrementally.},

AMoSL captures node correspondences between modalities via optimal transport, and jointly learning with graph embedding. To enable efficient end-to-end training, we employ an efficient solution for the resulting complex bilevel optimization problem. Furthermore, AMoSL adapts to downstream tasks through unsupervised learning on inter-modality distances. The effectiveness of AMoSL is demonstrated by its ability to train more accurate graph classifiers on six benchmark datasets.},

This paper introduces a novel gated graph neural network, namely FAKEDETECTOR. Based on a set of explicit and latent features extracted from the textual information, FAKEDETECTOR builds a deep diffusive network model to learn the representations of news articles, creators and subjects simultaneously. Extensive experiments have been done on a real-world fake news dataset to compare FAKEDETECTOR with several state-of-the-art models, and the experimental results are provided in the full-version of this paper at [13].},

Efficient methods for capturing, distinguishing, and filtering real and fake news are becoming increasingly important, especially after the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study conducts a multiaspect and systematic review of the current state and challenges of graph neural networks (GNNs) for fake news detection systems and outlines a comprehensive approach to implementing fake news detection systems using GNNs. Furthermore, advanced GNN-based techniques for implementing pragmatic fake news detection systems are discussed from multiple perspectives. First, we introduce the background and overview related to fake news, fake news detection, and GNNs. Second, we provide a GNN taxonomy-based fake news detection taxonomy and review and highlight models in categories. Subsequently, we compare critical ideas, advantages, and disadvantages of the methods in categories. Next, we discuss the possible challenges of fake news detection and GNNs. Finally, we present several open issues in this area and discuss potential directions for future research. We believe that this review can be utilized by systems practitioners and newcomers in surmounting current impediments and navigating future situations by deploying a fake news detection system using GNNs.},

However, easy access to information does not equal an increased level of public knowledge. Unlike traditional media channels, social networks also facilitate faster and wider spread of disinformation and misinformation. Viral spread of false information has serious implications on the behaviours, attitudes and beliefs of the public, and ultimately can seriously endanger the democratic processes. Limiting false information's negative impact through early detection and control of extensive spread presents the main challenge facing researchers today. In this survey paper, we extensively analyze a wide range of different solutions for the early detection of fake news in the existing literature. More precisely, we examine Machine Learning (ML) models for the identification and classification of fake news, online fake news detection competitions, statistical outputs as well as the advantages and disadvantages of some of the available data sets. Finally, we evaluate the online web browsing tools available for detecting and mitigating fake news and present some open research challenges.},

	abstract = {Social media for news consumption is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, its low cost, easy access, and rapid dissemination of information lead people to seek out and consume news from social media. On the other hand, it enables the wide spread of {\textbackslash}fake news", i.e., low quality news with intentionally false information. The extensive spread of fake news has the potential for extremely negative impacts on individuals and society. Therefore, fake news detection on social media has recently become an emerging research that is attracting tremendous attention. Fake news detection on social media presents unique characteristics and challenges that make existing detection algorithms from traditional news media ine ective or not applicable. First, fake news is intentionally written to mislead readers to believe false information, which makes it difficult and nontrivial to detect based on news content; therefore, we need to include auxiliary information, such as user social engagements on social media, to help make a determination. Second, exploiting this auxiliary information is challenging in and of itself as users' social engagements with fake news produce data that is big, incomplete, unstructured, and noisy. Because the issue of fake news detection on social media is both challenging and relevant, we conducted this survey to further facilitate research on the problem. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review of detecting fake news on social media, including fake news characterizations on psychology and social theories, existing algorithms from a data mining perspective, evaluation metrics and representative datasets. We also discuss related research areas, open problems, and future research directions for fake news detection on social media.},

The resulting learning algorithms have intimate connections with random walks, electric networks, and spectral graph theory. We discuss methods to incorporate class priors and the predictions of classiﬁers obtained by supervised learning.

In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).},

	abstract = {Recently popularized graph neural networks achieve the state-of-the-art accuracy on a number of standard benchmark datasets for graph-based semi-supervised learning, improving significantly over existing approaches. These architectures alternate between a propagation layer that aggregates the hidden states of the local neighborhood and a fully-connected layer. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that a linear model, that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, is still able to achieve a performance comparable to the state-of-the-art models. This significantly reduces the number of parameters, which is critical for semi-supervised learning where number of labeled examples are small. This in turn allows a room for designing more innovative propagation layers. Based on this insight, we propose a novel graph neural network that removes all the intermediate fully-connected layers, and replaces the propagation layers with attention mechanisms that respect the structure of the graph. The attention mechanism allows us to learn a dynamic and adaptive local summary of the neighborhood to achieve more accurate predictions. In a number of experiments on benchmark citation networks datasets, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms competing methods. By examining the attention weights among neighbors, we show that our model provides some interesting insights on how neighbors influence each other.},

Though GNNs are believed to outperform basic NNs in real-world tasks, it is found that in some cases, GNNs have little performance gain or even underperform graph-agnostic NNs. To identify these cases, based on graph signal processing and statistical hypothesis testing, we propose two measures which analyze the cases in which the edge bias in features and labels does not provide advantages. Based on the measures, a threshold value can be given to predict the potential performance advantages of graph-aware models over graph-agnostic models.},

	abstract = {Few-shot node classification, which aims to predict labels for nodes on graphs with only limited labeled nodes as references, is of great significance in real-world graph mining tasks. To tackle such a label shortage issue, existing works generally leverage the meta-learning framework, which utilizes a number of episodes to extract transferable knowledge from classes with abundant labeled nodes and generalizes the knowledge to other classes with limited labeled nodes. In essence, the primary aim of few-shot node classification is to learn node embeddings that are generalizable across different classes. To accomplish this, the GNN encoder must be able to distinguish node embeddings between different classes, while also aligning embeddings for nodes in the same class. Thus, in this work, we propose to consider both the intra-class and inter-class generalizability of the model. We create a novel contrastive meta-learning framework on graphs, named COSMIC, with two key designs. First, we propose to enhance the intra-class generalizability by involving a contrastive two-step optimization in each episode to explicitly align node embeddings in the same classes. Second, we strengthen the inter-class generalizability by generating hard node classes for classification via a novel similarity-sensitive mix-up strategy. Extensive experiments on prevalent few-shot node classification datasets verify the effectiveness of our framework and demonstrate its superiority over other state-of-the-art baselines.},

	abstract = {The wide availability of user-provided content in online social media facilitates the aggregation of people around common interests, worldviews, and narratives. However, the World Wide Web (WWW) also allows for the rapid dissemination of unsubstantiated rumors and conspiracy theories that often elicit rapid, large, but naive social responses such as the recent case of Jade Helm 15––where a simple military exercise turned out to be perceived as the beginning of a new civil war in the United States. In this work, we address the determinants governing misinformation spreading through a thorough quantitative analysis. In particular, we focus on how Facebook users consume information related to two distinct narratives: scientific and conspiracy news. We find that, although consumers of scientific and conspiracy stories present similar consumption patterns with respect to content, cascade dynamics differ. Selective exposure to content is the primary driver of content diffusion and generates the formation of homogeneous clusters, i.e., “echo chambers.” Indeed, homogeneity appears to be the primary driver for the diffusion of contents and each echo chamber has its own cascade dynamics. Finally, we introduce a data-driven percolation model mimicking rumor spreading and we show that homogeneity and polarization are the main determinants for predicting cascades’ size.},

Images in contexts depicting users as ‘social’, and positive or explanatory message captioning decreased during lockdown. Limited evidence was found to support the hypothesis that images posted were predictive of psychological well-being in lockdown.

	abstract = {In the modern era of digital technology, the rapid distribution of news via social media platforms substantially contributes to the propagation of false information, presenting challenges in upholding the accuracy and reliability of information. This study presents an updated approach that utilizes Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) alongside with advanced deep learning techniques to improve the identification of false information. In contrast to traditional approaches that primarily rely on analyzing text and assessing the credibility of sources, our methodology utilizes the structural information of news propagation networks. This allows for a detailed comprehension of the interconnections and patterns that are indicative of misinformation. By analyzing the intricate, graph-based connections between news items, our approach not only overcomes the constraints of conventional fake news detection methods but also demonstrates significant enhancements in detection accuracy. This paper emphasizes the revolutionary nature of utilizing GNNs in the field of fake news detection. It also examines the potential consequences of our research in reducing the propagation of false information. Our model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 97\%, demonstrating a significant improvement in its ability to identify and classify fake news.The findings highlight the substantial improvement in the ability to detect fake news provided by GNNs in comparison to traditional methods, demonstrating promising growth in the struggle against false information.},

            One widely used approach for quantifying misinformation consumption and sharing is to evaluate the quality of the news domains that a user interacts with. However, different media organizations and fact-checkers have produced different sets of news domain quality ratings, raising questions about the reliability of these ratings. In this study, we compared six sets of expert ratings and found that they generally correlated highly with one another. We then created a comprehensive set of domain ratings for use by the research community (github.com/hauselin/domain-quality-ratings), leveraging an ensemble “wisdom of experts” approach. To do so, we performed imputation together with principal component analysis to generate a set of aggregate ratings. The resulting rating set comprises 11,520 domains—the most extensive coverage to date—and correlates well with other rating sets that have more limited coverage. Together, these results suggest that experts generally agree on the relative quality of news domains, and the aggregate ratings that we generate offer a powerful research tool for evaluating the quality of news consumed or shared and the efficacy of misinformation interventions.},

	abstract = {Over the recent years, the growth of online social media has greatly facilitated the way people communicate with each other. Users of online social media share information, connect with other people and stay informed about trending events. However, much recent information appearing on social media is dubious and, in some cases, intended to mislead. Such content is often called fake news. Large amounts of online fake news has the potential to cause serious problems in society. Many point to the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign as having been influenced by fake news. Subsequent to this election, the term has entered the mainstream vernacular. Moreover it has drawn the attention of industry and academia, seeking to understand its origins, distribution and effects. Of critical interest is the ability to detect when online content is untrue and intended to mislead. This is technically challenging for several reasons. Using social media tools, content is easily generated and quickly spread, leading to a large volume of content to analyse. Online information is very diverse, covering a large number of subjects, which contributes complexity to this task. The truth and intent of any statement often cannot be assessed by computers alone, so efforts must depend on collaboration between humans and technology. For instance, some content that is deemed by experts of being false and intended to mislead are available. While these sources are in limited supply, they can form a basis for such a shared effort. In this survey, we present a comprehensive overview of the finding to date relating to fake news. We characterize the negative impact of online fake news, and the state-of-the-art in detection methods. Many of these rely on identifying features of the users, content, and context that indicate misinformation. We also study existing datasets that have been used for classifying fake news. Finally, we propose promising research directions for online fake news analysis.},

This study focuses on interactive engagement with online news videos. We propose a theoretical framework for conceptualizing user engagement on a continuum from exposure to interactivity. Furthermore, we make a distinction between user–content (e.g. commenting) and user–user (e.g. replying to another user’s comment) modes of interaction. We then explore publicly available measures of these concepts and test a series of hypotheses to explore commenting and conversational behaviors in response to YouTube news videos. We conclude by discussing the theoretical and practical implications for advancing our understanding of user engagement with online news.},
